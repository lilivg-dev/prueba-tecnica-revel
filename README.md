# Revel Frontend Developer Code Test 👩‍💻

Here are some notes I would like to make about my test and a preview of the project can be found [here](https://prueba-tecnica-revel-357c.vercel.app/).

## 👀 UX elements 

Here are the items I found missing:

- Providing a visibility button on the password input to ensure the password is typed correctly.
- Adding an 'All' filter will allow users to return to all genres once they click on one of them.
- As a final addition, adding a button that allows the user to return to the Home page when you are on a movie's detail page.

## ‼️ MUI (do not be alarmed) 

Yes, I have installed the MUI library.

However, not to use it in the components but to appropriate its `useMediaQueryMUI` as it is very useful when creating the media query for responsive.

## ⏳ Pending tasks

There have been a couple of things that I have not been able to finish due to lack of time.

 - The home fold slider.
 - Connect to the API


## ✏️ Final conclusion 

I would like to share my impressions of the test. Although I consider it not a complicated test, I would say that it is long. In a week dedicated to it, you could accomplish it without any problem, but you would need the time to do it.

It would have been great if I had been able to finish it, but due to work obligations I have not been able to.
